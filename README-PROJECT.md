# Connected Devices - Semester Project Summary

## Lab Module 12 - Semester Project

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-INF-12-* requirements listed at [PIOT-INF-12-001 - Chapter 12](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-10488565).

### Description

On the following page(s), be sure to address the following four topics: 
- What - The Problem
- Why - Who Cares?
- How - Actual Technical Approach
- Results - Actual Outcomes


### What - The Problem 

NOTE: Write one or two paragraphs to answer EACH of the following questions.

What problem are you trying to solve and why does it matter?


### Why - Who Cares? 

Why do you care about this particular problem? 
 

### How - Actual Technical Approach

NOTE: Provide a high level system diagram depicting your planned technical approach. This should be a relatively
simple block diagram - you do NOT need to create a UML diagram for the proposal, although you should provide
specifics on which protocols you plan to use, where theyâ€™ll be used, and how you plan to communicate between
your constrained device, gateway device, and cloud services. You may make changes to this for the final
implementation if needed - this should serve merely as a guide. 

#### System Diagram


#### What THREE (3) sensors and ONE (1) actuator did you leverage (add more if you wish)?
- CDA Sensor 1: 
- CDA Sensor 2: 
- CDA Sensor 3: 
- CDA Actuator 1: 

#### What ONE (1) CDA protocol and THREE (3) GDA protocols did you implement (add more if you wish)?
- CDA Protocol 1: 

- GDA Protocol 1: 
- GDA Protocol 2: 
- GDA Protocol 3: 
 
#### What TWO (2) cloud services / capabilities did you use (add more if you wish)?
- Cloud Service 1 (ingress):
- Cloud Service 2 (egress):
 
### Results - Actual Outcomes and Visualization Screen Shot(s)

#### Outcomes Achieved

NOTE: Write a paragraph or two describing your actual achieved outcomes. 

#### Screen Shots Representing Visualized Data

NOTE: Include (at least) TWO (2) screen shots - one showing at least 2 hours
of time-series data from the CDA, and one showing an event being triggered
that results in an actuation event sent to your GDA and then to your CDA.

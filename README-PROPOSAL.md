# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 12 - Semester Project Proposal

### Description

On the following page(s), be sure to address the following four topics: 
- What - The Problem
- Why - Who Cares?
- How - Expected Technical Approach
- Results - Expected Outcomes


### What - The Problem 

NOTE: Write one or two paragraphs to answer EACH of the following questions.

What problem are you trying to solve and why does it matter?


### Why - Who Cares? 

Why do you care about this particular problem? 
 

### How - Expected Technical Approach

NOTE: Provide a high level design diagram depicting your planned technical approach. This should be a relatively
simple block diagram - you do NOT need to create a UML diagram for the proposal, although you should provide
specifics on which protocols you plan to use, where theyâ€™ll be used, and how you plan to communicate between
your constrained device, gateway device, and cloud services. You may make changes to this for the final
implementation if needed - this should serve merely as a guide. 

 
### Results - Expected Outcomes 

NOTE: Write one or two paragraphs to answer the following question.

If your project is successful, what outcome do you expect (e.g. what will happen if everything works)?
